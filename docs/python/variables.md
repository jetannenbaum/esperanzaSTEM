## Variable Names:
- Must start with a letter or an underscore
- Can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
- Case sensitive (Angle is _not_ the ame as angle)

## Variables Can Hold a Variety of Things
- Text: angle = "Ninety degrees"
- A number with a decimal point: angle = 90.0
- A number without a decimal point: angle = 90
- A collection: angle = ["Ninety", 90.0, 90]
