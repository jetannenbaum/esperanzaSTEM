We will be working with the Raspberry Pi pIico.  It is a low-cost ($4.00), high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. Key features include:

- RP2040 microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi in the United Kingdom

- Dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor, flexible clock running up to 133 MHz

- 264kB of SRAM, and 2MB of on-board flash memory

- USB 1.1 with device and host support

- Low-power sleep and dormant modes

- Drag-and-drop programming using mass storage over USB

- 26 multi-function GPIO pins

- 2 SPI, 2 I2C, 2 UART, 3 12-bit ADC, 16 controllable PWM channels

- Accurate clock and timer on-chip

- Temperature sensor

- Accelerated floating-point libraries on-chip

- 8 Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines for custom peripheral support
