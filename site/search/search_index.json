Perfect for beginners Its conciseness, expressiveness, and likeness to English, all contribute to its popularity. 2. Community A large community also means availability of a large number of libraries, modules, and packages to help you with your project. 3. Career Opportunities In the professional world, Python and Ruby developers earn the second highest salaries, next to Swift. 4. Web Development Several frameworks are available: Django, Pylons, web2py, and Flask. Of these, Django and Flask are quite impressive. 5. Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning Today, Python is preferred as the language for computer science research, making use of SciPy and NumPy libraries. 6. Raspberry Pi With MicroPython you can make robots, arcade machines, remote-controlled toys, and even cameras. And with Sonic Pi, you can even make music. 7. Startups and Corporations Giants like Google, Disney, and NASA are always on the lookout for talented Python professionals.","title":"Why Python"},{"location":"python/whyPython/#why-study-python","text":"","title":"Why study Python?"},{"location":"python/whyPython/#7-reasons-to-study-python","text":"","title":"7 Reasons to study Python"},{"location":"python/whyPython/#1-perfect-for-beginners","text":"Its conciseness, expressiveness, and likeness to English, all contribute to its popularity.","title":"1.
